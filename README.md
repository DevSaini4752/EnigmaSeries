# Enigma Series

The **Enigma** project is a personal cryptography journey aimed at building custom encryption-decryption systems using Python. It started as a learning experiment and has evolved over multiple versions.

## Overview of Versions

- **Enigma 0.1, 1.0, 1.9, and 2.0** 
  These early versions were developed during the initial phase of my learning. They served as experimental builds to test encryption logic. 
  However, they were **not designed to be scalable, maintainable, or modular**. 
  Hence, their codebase is **not in good condition** and may lack readability or structure.

- **Enigma 3.0 and onward** 
  Starting from version **3.0**, the architecture has been **significantly improved**. 
  These newer builds follow a **modular approach**, with a clean file structure and focus on:
  - **Scalability**
  - **Maintainability**
  - **Separation of Concerns** 
  Enigma 3.0 represents a major shift toward production-level coding standards.

## Purpose

The Enigma Series is built to:
- Explore custom encryption methodologies.
- Improve coding structure and best practices over time.
- Simulate real-world software development workflows.

> This project is under continuous development, with regular improvements and version upgrades planned.

Stay tuned for future upgrades like **Enigma 3.1, 3.2, and 4.0** â€” with better security, shorter keys, and dynamic encryption logic!
