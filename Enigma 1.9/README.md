# Enigma 1.9

**Enigma 1.9** is an enhanced version of Enigma 1.0 that maintains the same core encryption logic but adds the ability to handle different file formats.

## Features

- Same substitution cipher logic as Enigma 1.0
- Supports encryption and decryption for:
  - Plain text (`.txt`)
  - PDF documents (`.pdf`)
  - Word documents (`.docx`)
  - Direct text input

## Limitations

- Static substitution key
- Encryption logic still fixed and predictable
- File handling introduces I/O complexity but not encryption strength
- Not scalable and maintainable

## Purpose

This version was created to practice file handling and broaden the applicability of the encryption logic across various formats.
