# Enigma 0.1

**Enigma 0.1** is the foundational version in the Enigma encryption series, developed at the very beginning of my Python journey. It uses extremely basic encryption logic and was primarily built to explore string manipulation in Python.

## Features

- Basic text encryption and decryption
- Static encryption logic (no key usage)
- Simple transformations like:
  - String reversal
  - Appending predefined characters

## Limitations

- No key management
- Extremely weak encryption (for learning purposes only)
- Not suitable for any practical or secure use

## Purpose

This version was purely experimental and intended to build initial familiarity with basic Python operations such as strings, loops, and function creation.
