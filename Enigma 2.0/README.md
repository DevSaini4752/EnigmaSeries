# Enigma 2.0

**Enigma 2.0** is the first version in the Enigma series to introduce dynamic encryption. It uses a randomly generated 90-character token as the decryption key and produces unique output for every encryption attempt.

## Features

- Dynamically generated key for every session
- 90-character token used as a decryption key
- Fully unique encrypted output on every execution
- Improved structure compared to previous versions
- Works with direct text encryption and decryption

## Limitations

- Single-token logic (one key for the entire message)
- Token must be securely stored by the user
- Does not yet support per-character dynamic logic

## Purpose

This version was a major step forward in understanding randomness, token generation, and secure key handling. It introduced one-time pad-style encryption fundamentals and moved the project toward real-world cryptographic practices.
