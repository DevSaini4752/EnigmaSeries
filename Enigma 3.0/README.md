**Version 3.0** 
**Developed By Dev**

## INTRODUCTION

Enigma 3.0 is a modular Encryption-Decryption system which can be used by anyone for secret and safe communication. It is also designed to take different files or format of message i.e. (plain text, .txt, .pdf, .docx)

It uses dynamic key system to make it unpredictable and safest of all the version of enigma series till now.

## TIME TOOK TO MAKE THIS PROJECT

- 11 April 2025 - 28 April 2025

---

## FEATURES

- Multi module system 
- Dynamic 600 digit decryption token 
- 6 different dynamic key for every message 
- Messages and docstrings for user 
- Great structure for understanding 
- All the kind for exceptions are handled 
- Highly user friendly CLI 
- Unpredictable as of dynamic 6 different keys 
- Follow Kerckhoffs' Principle 

---

## ABOUT MODULER STRUCTURE

This project is having a fully modular structure, it have module for every function, which makes it very easy to understand, debug and upgrade.

---

## LOGIC

- Uses 6 dynamic keys 
- Polyalphabetic encryption scheme 
- Key choice varies based on character index 
- Makes decryption unpredictable 
- Prevents pattern detection 

---

## MAINTAINABILITY, SCALABILITY AND READABILITY

- Maintainable and scalable due to modular structure 
- Readable due to simple messages for fellow coder and docstrings 
- Custom exception are there explaining the coder and user about exception in very simple and detailed language, this makes it user and coder friendly.

## SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

- Windows 10+ 
- Min. 4 GB RAM 
- Microsoft 2013+ 

---

## HOW TO USE

- Open the Enigma 3.0 
- Choose the option for encryption-decryption 
- Choose option for input type (plain text or file) 
- Enter the file name or message 
- Enter Token (if decryption) 
- Get your message or file 

---

## LIMITATIONS

- Can access all files 
- Can't encrypt images 
- May take time in huge files 

---

## FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS

- Fully numeric encryption 
- Better logic, More safe 
- More professional 
- More dynamic keys 
- Shorter decryption token
