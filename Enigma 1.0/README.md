# Enigma 1.0

**Enigma 1.0** is the first structured release in the Enigma encryption series. It introduced key-based encryption logic and marked the transition from static to more logical systems.

## Features

- Key-based encryption and decryption
- Every character is mapped to another specific character using a custom dictionary
- Works with plain text input/output

## Limitations

- Static key mapping (the same each time)
- Does not support file operations
- Limited resistance to brute-force or pattern-based attacks

## Purpose

The project was developed to apply dictionary mapping in Python and understand the core logic behind substitution ciphers. It laid the foundation for future versions that expanded on encryption complexity.
